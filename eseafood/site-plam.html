      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Tacos have a rich and diverse history that traces back to ancient Mesoamerican cultures. The word "taco" is believed to originate from the Nahuatl language, referring to a “plug” or “wad.” Originally, tacos were simple tortillas filled with available ingredients like beans, fish, or meat. The modern taco as we know it began to take shape in the 19th century, particularly in Mexico City, where street vendors popularized various fillings. Today, tacos are celebrated worldwide, with countless regional variations showcasing local flavors and traditions, making them not just a meal, but a symbol of cultural heritage and culinary creativity.
